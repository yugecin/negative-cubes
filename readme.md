as always, mess of code because it was "finished"
5 minutes before the deadline :)

the mentioned 2d shader I made: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wdfGRX

```
$ cat negative-cubes.nfo

//// negative cubes

released in the Revision 2024 Animated GIF compo

same negative space concept from a 2d shader I made 5 years ago, but now 3d.
more dimensions = more awesome except I can't get the lighting right :(

Special thanks to Seven for teaching me a quick hack to get rid
of some artifact problems I was having while
on the Luxembourg - Saarbrooklyn bus

GLSL shader, custom Crinkler-linked program to render frames,
ffmpeg to combine frames into GIF

fuckings to those who pulled the emergency brake on our train yesterday

greetings to Bongo, Aurora, Kris :)
